# Getting Started with React E-Commerce Web App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick Demo
For a quick preview of the website in your "Computer/Mobile Phone", you can visit this link: <br>

But I suggest that you clone this repository and follow the instructions below to write/view user reviews in the JSON server.

## Instructions

In the project directory, you should run the following commands:

### `npm install`
Installs node_modules in the project directory.
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
### `npx json-server --watch data/reviews.json --port 8000`
Runs the JSON server that will show the reviews in the "Review Component". You need to run this command to "POST" a review in the app.
